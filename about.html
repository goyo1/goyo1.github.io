			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my website! We probably know each other in person, as it's highly unlikely a random internet stranger would somehow stumble upon this webpage. However, if that <em>is</em> the case, then hey, what's up, hope you're doing well. This is just a fun little project I chose to work on. Goyo Tech isn't a real thing, it's just an inside joke that started at a family birthday party that I sort of made real. Who knows if the idea will grow beyond its current manifestation.

			A small about-me: I graduated college in 2018 with a B.S. in Mathematics. My favorite branch of mathematics is combinatorics, and my hobbies include reading, fitness, and playing video games. Thanks for taking the time to read this. If you have any suggestions for ways I can improve my website, feel free to contact me. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Sincerely, 
			<br>
			Goyo. </p>
